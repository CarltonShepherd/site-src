Slug: about

I am a Security Researcher at OneSpan, a financial technology firm based in Brussels, Belgium. I completed my Ph.D. in Information Security at the [Information Security Group, Royal Holloway, University of London](https://isg.rhul.ac.uk) and hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Newcastle University](https://ncl.ac.uk).

My current research interests surround secure and private computing in machine learning systems, specifically the use of:

* Trusted execution environments (TEEs), such as ARM TrustZone and Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX), and related trusted computing technologies, e.g. TPMs.
* Homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation (MPC).

More generally, I'm interested in applied cryptography, including the design and implementation of security protocols; mobile and embedded systems security; and . My Ph.D. topic focussed on the use of TEEs on embedded/IoT devices for providing greater trust assurances regarding the collection, transformation and transmission of sensor data for related ML applications. A list of my publications can be found [here](/publications/).
