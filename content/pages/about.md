Thanks for visiting my site.

I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [Information Security Group (ISG), Royal Holloway, University of London](https://isg.rhul.ac.uk). My current research focusses on the use and abuse of trusted execution environments (TEEs), mobile systems security, and encrypted computation. I am funded by the EU Horizon 2020 EXFILES project, which unifies European intelligence and law enforcement agencies, the private sector, and a small number of university partners (of which the ISG is one). The goal is to develop novel methods for data extraction from modern mobile devices for forensics, including cryptanalysis and other circumvention methods applied to TEEs, full-disk encryption, and related mechanisms.

Before my current role, I was a Data Scientist at [Atom Bank](https://www.atombank.co.uk), the UK's first mobile bank, where I worked in a small team building high assurance ETL pipelines for Â£3bn+ savings and mortgage reporting. Prior to this, I was a Research Scientist at the [OneSpan](https://www.onespan.com), a NASDAQ-listed financial technology company in Cambridge, UK, where I focussed on secure machine learning for user authentication, KYC and fraud detection. This also included the application of confidential computing techniques, such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), multi-party computation (MPC), and TEEs. Before OneSpan, I worked as a Mobile Security Engineer at Samsung's R&D Institute, supporting Common Criteria evaluations of flagship smartphones.

I hold a Ph.D. in Information Security from [Royal Holloway, University of London](https://isg.rhul.ac.uk) and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Newcastle University](https://ncl.ac.uk).

My technical skills include:

* Trusted execution environments (TEEs), including ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX and the GlobalPlatform specifications.
* Commercial experience in product deployment; programming in Python, C, and Java; SQL (Postgres and SQLite); data analysis and machine learning libraries, inc. PyLab, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, and Keras; and Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
* Building data-driven systems for security and high assurance applications.

I am also the author of:

* python-paillier: a Python implementation of Paillier's homomorphic encryption scheme.
* pycocks: a fast implementation of Cocks' identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme based on the quadratic residue problem.

Both are available via PyPi.
